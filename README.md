# micropython_robotics
Some micropython codes I have written as part of a mechtronics college course project.

The bots were 3D printed with omni-wheels and ran micropython on ESP8266 
chips.

A server running OpenCV was used together with the Aruco Marker library to 
locate the robots and send positions to them via. Sockets.
